SpartaSimulatorProject-Group2
Requirements:

• The tracker needs to be able to track time in a consistent way.

• The program starts by asking how long the simulation will run for.

• Every month, a random number of trainees are generated wanting to be trained (20 -30).

• Every 2 months, Sparta global opens a training centre. They open instantly and can take trainees every month.

• A centre can train a max of 100 trainees and takes a random number of trainees every month.
(0 - 20 trainees per month up to the max capacity).

• If a centre is full, trainees can be moved to any other centre which is not full

• If all centres are full, the trainees go onto a waiting list.
(This list must be served first before new trainees are taken)

• At the end of the simulation, output should show:

Number of open centres.
Number of full centres.
Number of trainees currently training.
Number of trainees on the waiting list.
